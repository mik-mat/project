# Introduction

Cities have long been home to concentrations of demographically distinct populations, often consisting of immigrants and their recent descendants. Among the benefits these communities bring are their unique culinary traditions. Often, their neighborhoods can be identified by the presence of restaurants serving their traditional cuisines. This project will attempt to identify ethnic enclaves in an American city by analyzing the presence of ethnic restaurants. This analysis will be of interest to gourmands, tourists, demographers, and municipal officials.

# Data

This analysis will limit itself to the neighborhoods of New York, a global city home to a diverse population. The postal codes and their corresponding GPS coordinates are sourced from a dataset titled "US Zip Code Latitude and Longitude" published by CivicSpace Labs. The restaurant information will be extracted via the Foursquare Venue Search API.
